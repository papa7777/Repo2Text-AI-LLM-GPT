# Repo2Text-AI-LLM-GPT
This code takes a Git repository path as input and outputs a text file containing the contents of the repository, preserving the structure of the files and file contents. The output file can be interpreted by AI language models.
To use this code, save it to a file (e.g. git_to_text.py) and run it from the command line as follows:

bash
Copy code
python git_to_text.py /path/to/git/repository [-o /path/to/output_file.txt]
The -o option allows you to specify the output file path. If not specified, the output file will be named output.txt and saved in the current directory.

After running this code, ChatGPT should be able to use the generated text file to process the contents of the Git repository.
