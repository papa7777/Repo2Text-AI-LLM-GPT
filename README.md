# Repo2Text-AI-LLM-GPT
This code takes a Git repository path as input and outputs a text file containing the contents of the repository, preserving the structure of the files and file contents. The output file can be interpreted by AI language models.
To use this code, save it to a file (e.g. git2text.py) and run it from the command line as follows:
Usage
-----
To use Git2Text, simply run the `git2text.py` script with the path to a Git repository as the first argument:

By default, Git2Text will generate a file named `output.txt` in the current directory. You can customize the output file name and location using the `-o` option:

You can also include a preamble text at the beginning of the output file using the `-p` option:
bash

Copy code

python git2textt.py /path/to/git/repository [-o /path/to/output_file.txt]

After running this code, ChatGPT should be able to use the generated text file to process the contents of the Git repository.
